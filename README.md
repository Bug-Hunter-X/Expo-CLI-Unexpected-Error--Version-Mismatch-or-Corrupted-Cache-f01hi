# Expo CLI Unexpected Error: Version Mismatch or Corrupted Cache

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: unexpected errors stemming from version mismatches or corrupted caches.  The issue typically manifests as build failures or other unexpected behavior during development.

## Problem

The `expo` command might fail with an error message that is not immediately clear, often related to version inconsistencies or corrupted cache files.

## Solution

The provided solution outlines various steps to troubleshoot and fix the issue, including verifying Expo CLI, Node.js, and npm versions; clearing the Expo cache; and reinstalling dependencies.

## Steps to Reproduce (bug.js)

1. Create a new Expo project (if you don't have one already).
2. Introduce intentional version conflicts (e.g., using an older Expo SDK version in `app.json` while having a newer Expo CLI). 
3. Attempt to run `expo start` or build your app using `expo build`. Observe the resulting error messages.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

1. **Verify Expo CLI Version:**  Use `expo -v` to check your installed version.  Update if necessary using `npm install -g expo-cli@latest` or `yarn global add expo-cli@latest`.
2. **Verify Node.js and npm/yarn Versions:** Ensure you're using supported versions of Node.js and a compatible package manager (npm or yarn). Refer to Expo's documentation for compatibility details.
3. **Clear Expo Cache:**  Run `expo prebuild --clean` to clear the Expo cache and temporary files that may be causing conflicts.
4. **Reinstall Dependencies:**  Delete your `node_modules` folder and reinstall packages using `npm install` or `yarn install`. 
5. **Check app.json/expo.json:** Ensure your project's `expo.json` (or `app.json` for older projects) file specifies compatible Expo SDK versions with your CLI and other dependencies. If the sdkVersion is out of sync with your Expo CLI update the sdk version using the expo upgrade command.
6. **Invalidate Caches (Advanced):** In rare cases, you might need to clear browser caches or other system-level caches to ensure there are no remnants of older Expo versions interfering.

If the problem persists, provide more specific error messages from your terminal for better diagnostics.
